#In this code, we create a Pygame window and set up a loop to handle events and display the "Hello World" message. When you click on the window, the message will appear for two seconds and then disappear. The pygame.time.get_ticks() function is used to keep track of the time elapsed. The text is rendered using a font and displayed at the center of the screen. Make sure you have the Pygame library installed (pip install pygame) before running this code.






#Make sure you have the pygame library installed (pip install pygame) before running this code. This code creates a window and draws 28 white circles evenly spaced in a circular pattern around the center of the window. The circles are positioned based on their angles around the center of the circle, creating the circular arrangement you're looking for.
